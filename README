Go Chat! - the stupid chat server written in Go.

It's stupidly simple:

1. Compile it
2. Run it
3. Telnet into localhost:9999

Now, a bunch of features is needed:

 * Nice formatting (screw Sprintf + TCPConn.Write :/)
 * Sending a list of connected nicks to new users
 * Remove users when they disconnect

Please do that.
